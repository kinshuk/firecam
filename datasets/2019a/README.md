The 2019a dataset contains both smoke and non smoke images.  The smoke side has two parts: 1) [full images containing smokes](https://storage.googleapis.com/oct-fire-public/datasets/2019a-smoke-full.zip), and 2) an associated file containing the [bounding box coordinates](2019a-bounding-boxes.csv) for rectangular regions with smoke within each image.  The non-smoke side of the dataset contains [299x299 pixel image segments](https://storage.googleapis.com/oct-fire-public/datasets/2019a-non-smoke-segments.tgz).

This dataset is used in conjuction with firecam (https://github.com/open-climate-tech/firecam) repository, and the methodology is described in this [paper](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12010166) published in Remote Sensing journal.
